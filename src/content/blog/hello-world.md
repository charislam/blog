Despite enjoying writing, I've never been brave enough to publicly blog.
In an Internet awash with guides and opinions, what could I possibly say that hasn't been said better by someone else?

The answer is still "possibly nothing".
But I've found some spare time to reflect lately, which means my thoughts have been more lucidly put (in my own head) than they usually are.
And I like the feeling, so I've carved out a little space to perpetuate it.

Here be random opinions, lightly held.
Perhaps subject to the whim of the moment.

Hello, world.
Welcome to my corner of the Internet.
